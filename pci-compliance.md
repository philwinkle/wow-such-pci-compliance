# _PCI Myths_

![cover](unicorn.jpg)

---

## 1. If I _**don't store**_ credit cards PCI _**doesn't apply**_

---

# [fit] _FALSE_

![cover original](schrute.jpg)

---

> The only way to avoid PCI compliance is to transfer the risk entirely to someone else ... where credit card information never traverses your own servers[^1]

-- Focus on PCI

---

## 2. Magento is PCI Compliant, so therefore _**I'm PCI compliant**_

---

# [fit] _FALSE_

### **(kinda)**

![cover original](jim-dwight.png)

---

### Magento is PCI DSS compliant _only_ when used *in conjuction* with Secure Payment Bridge[^2]

---

# Why isn't Magento *itself* PCI compliant?

- Magento is monolithic 
- Swift update deployment
- Limit the scope of feature impact
- $$$$

---

## 3. I am in the EU/AUS/Antarctica and I don't need to abide by PCI

---

# [fit] _FALSE_

---

# You can't un-hack your site

---

# [fit]How long until a _default<br>Magento CE 1.9.0.0_ is **hacked**?

---

# [fit]18 minutes

## Do you use _**3rd party**_ modules?

---

## Do you use _source control_ for deployments?

#### _Check yoursite.com/.git and yoursite.com/var right away_

---

## What happens if<br> _**an employee**_ takes a credit card _over the phone?_


---

## _Do you have WiFi?_<br/> I bet you do.

---

## When was your last _security scan?_

---

## What is your _log retention policy_ and is it stored **offsite**, and for _**how long**_?

--- 

## What is your _password policy?_

---

## What _do you do_ in case of a data breach?

---

## What is your _backup strategy?_

---

## Do you have a _staging environment?_

---

## Do you have _separate_ development environments?

---
